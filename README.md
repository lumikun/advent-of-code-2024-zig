# Solutions for Advent of Code 2024 in Zig

Learning Zig or something I guess. Just for fun.

## How to run:
Simply go into the day's folder and `zig run dX.zig`. For now that's how I'm doing it, but I might refactor everything into a single executable once I get a better understanding of Zig.

## Day 1 
Simple problem, but doing it in a language you haven't done anything in is a bit wonky and slow. Still fun.
### Problem 1
Day 1 Problem 1 has been solved, relativelly simple.
### Problem 2 
Day 1 Problem 2 has been solved, it was easier in my opinion :^)
